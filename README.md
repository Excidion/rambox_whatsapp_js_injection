# Rambox WhatsApp JavaScript Injection
Fixes the display of Telegram WhatsApp within the Rambox application.

Just copy the contents of [`custom_code.js`](./custom_code.js) into the text field called **Custom Code** in the **Advanced** Options of the WhatsApp Service.

Inspired by the [`service.css`](https://github.com/meetfranz/recipe-whatsapp/blob/master/service.css) from [meetfranz/recipe-telegram](https://github.com/meetfranz/recipe-whatsapp) and [these instructions](https://github.com/ramboxapp/community-edition/wiki/Inject-JavaScript-Code).
